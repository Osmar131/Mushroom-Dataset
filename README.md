# Musroom dataset project
The dataset provided by The Audobon Society Field Guide to North American Mushroom (1981) contains descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of mushrooms of the Agaricus and Lepiota families. Each species is classified as edible or poisonous.

# Summary
Classifying each fungal sample in the dataset allows knowing if a mushroom with the provided characteristics is edible or poisonous.

For the classification problem, it is proposed to use the Random Forest ensemble algorithm.

# Training
Random Forest builds a set of trees with library sklearn and the prediction is the average of the results of each individual prediction of each tree.

# Results
The metrics obtained show good performance with the Random Forest trained model.
